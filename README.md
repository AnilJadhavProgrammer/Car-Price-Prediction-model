**Car Price Prediction**
**Overview**

This project aims to predict car prices using various machine learning techniques. The dataset is sourced from the quikr_car.csv file, and the script preprocesses the data to make it suitable for building predictive models. The project is implemented in Python and makes use of popular data science libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is quikr_car.csv, which contains information about various cars including their year, price, kilometers driven, fuel type, and more.

**Project Structure**

quikr_car.csv: The dataset used for the analysis.
Car_Price_Prediction.py: Python script containing the data cleaning and prediction steps.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions.
Installation
To run the analysis, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install the required libraries using pip:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

**Usage**

1. Prepare the Dataset: Ensure that the quikr_car.csv file is in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the Script: Execute the following command to preprocess the data and start the prediction process.
python Car_Price_Prediction.py
